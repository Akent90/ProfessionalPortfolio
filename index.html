        <p>
          Hi, I'm Alex! At the core of my professional and personal ethos lies a
          deep commitment to the principles of LDRSHIP - Loyalty, Duty, Respect,
          Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. These
          values, instilled in me during my time in the Army, continue to guide
          my approach to life and work. I am also a strong proponent of the
          servant leader model, believing that true leadership comes from
          serving and empowering others. Military service, coupled with a
          frontline role in my community hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic,
          has profoundly shaped my perspective. These challenging, yet enriching
          experiences, have reinforced my belief in teamwork, resilience, and
          the relentless pursuit of meaningful goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I look to the future, I aim to be an integral part of a team, lead
          with purpose, and contribute to building something that positively
          impacts our collective digital future. I am driven by the desire to
          create solutions that not only serve immediate needs but also pave the
          way for a more inclusive and technologically advanced society. My
          journey has been one of continuous learning, adaptation, and a
          relentless pursuit of excellence, always with an eye towards serving
          others and bettering our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was first introduced to programming through my job in the Army.
          Executing complex programming protocols for radar hard drives,
          configuring and managing local area networks, and optimizing
          functionality and security in mission-critical situations completely
          solidified my love for functional utility. I am driven to integrate
          this practical reliability with streamlined efficiency to bridge
          utility and elegance.
